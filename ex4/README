The program Defines an array of integers of fifty thousand cells,
and inserts into the array numbers in the range of zero to two
hundred thousand (not including two hundred thousand).
The purpose of the program is to delete the numbers in the array,
using numbers it receives from other programs.
The program receives through the argument vector the name of
the pipe it will use, and these names of the children.

         	          
compile:gcc -Wall ex4a1.c -o ex4a1
Run:./ex4a1 fifo0 fifo1 fifo2 fifo3

note: If you want to run this program  u should compile
      & run ex4a2.c 3. time. each time the process will
      communicte with this program via another fifo.
      The names of the queues will be fifo0...fifo3.
      when fifo0 is the fifo with the process communicte
      write to this program.

Input: No input.
 
Output: the output will be(seperated by spaces):
        1. The time it took to delete all the numbers from the 
           array.
        2. the amout of numbers that the process got sent.
            (i.e. how many try of deletion from the array).
        3. The size of the array assigned to the program.

This program receives through the argument vector the name of the
queue and fifo0, and the number of the current process (1,2,3)
which will also determine the name of the queue file through which 
the current process will receive feedback on whether the number it
sent to plan A was received / rejected The one that runs will be 
given a different name)

         	          
compile:gcc -Wall ex4a2.c -o ex4a2
Run:./ex4a2 fifo0 <num>

note: you need to send make 3 process of ex4a2, to each one send 
      his own number.

Input: No input.
 
Output: the output will be:
        1. the amout of numbers that the process sent.
         (i.e. how many try of deletion from the array).
        2. The amount of successfull deletions.

        note: the output will be seperated by spaces.

The program recive numbers with the messege queue from N programs 
and send  them is the apeared in the array of number 
that was stored it and print in the end how many number
were correct , how many number have been recived by the player ,
and how much time it took to guess all the numbers.

Register server program
The program register manage users in the server,
if user requested to sign up the server will register him
if he is already register the server will send messege he is already
registered,if no space left the server will notify about that, 
the server operate according to the following requsted type.
'1' - register the user/pid.
'2' - check if the giving pid exist.
'3' - sign out the givin pid.
  	 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compile : gcc -Wall ex4c1.c -o ex4c1 
Run     : ./ex4c1

Input:None
  
Output:according to the requsted operation
register the user: 
0-user added succseffuly,
1-user already exist,
2-no space
check if user exits:
0 - not existed.
1 - existed.

 Server application
 The program check if the giving str by messege queue is palindrom
 or prime numbe from the cliend,before doing the checking the data,
 the server check if the giving client is registered, if not the server
 return -1 answer.
 
 input:operation type
 1 - check if the number is prime or not.
 2 - check if the giving str is palindrom.
 
 output:according to the operation
 1 - prime or not prime.
 2 - palindrom or not palindrom. 
 user not registered - "-1"

Compile : gcc -Wall ex4c2.c -o ex4c2 
Run     : run ./ex4c2 after ./ex4c1.c

Input:
None
  
Output:according to the requsted operation
register the user: 
0-user added succseffuly,
1-user already exist,

description:

Client program
The program communicate with register,and application server.
the program first register the client(process) in the register
server and then wait for user input command and input accordinly
to the input command,the following input recived
from the user are:
'n' - for number input
's' - for the string input to recive.
'e' - to sign out from the register server and exit.

if n recived,the client send to the application server to 
check if the data is prime.
if s recived, the client send to the application sercer to
check if the string is palindrom.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compile : gcc -Wall ex4c3.c -o ex4c3 
Run     : run ./ex4c3.c after ./ex4c2.c and ./ex4c1.c

Input:char and input according to inserted char
 n - number
 s - string
 e - exit program

Output:according to the operation
 1 - prime or not prime.
 2 - palindrom or not palindrom. 
 user not registered - "-1"
